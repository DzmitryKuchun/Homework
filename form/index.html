            <p>The Dominican Republic is a country in the Caribbean located on the island of Haiti. The western part of the island is occupied by the Republic of Haiti. The country is famous for its beaches, resorts and golf courses. Its territory is covered with tropical forests, savannahs and mountains, the highest of which is Mount Duarte. The capital, Santo Domingo, has retained evidence of Spanish domination, such as the Gothic Cathedral of the Blessed Virgin Mary, built five centuries ago in what is now the "Colonial Zone"</p>
